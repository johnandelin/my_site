# Introduction

I am a Statistics student at Brigham Young University with an emphasis in Data Science. I am interested in using data to solve real-world problems, particularly in health, and public safety. Before Statistics I was studying microbiology and was involvd in research.

Through coursework, research, and personal projects, I have developed a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data science tools across R and Python ecosystems.

# Get to Know Me

Outside of statistics, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors, particularly through rock climbing and hiking. I am also passionate about music, playing both the viola and clarinet, and participate in ensembles at BYU. Additionally, I maintain an interest in current research in health and technology.
