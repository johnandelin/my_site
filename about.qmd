# Introduction

I am a Statistics student at Brigham Young University with an emphasis in applied statistics and analytics. I am interested in using data to solve real-world problems, particularly in health, public safety, and scientific research contexts. I enjoy building statistical models, designing reproducible workflows, and translating complex analyses into clear, actionable insights.

Through coursework, research, and professional experience, I have developed a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data science tools across R and Python ecosystems.
